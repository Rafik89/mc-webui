## Viewing Messages

The main page displays chat history from the currently selected channel. The app uses an intelligent refresh system that checks for new messages every 10 seconds and updates the UI only when new messages actually arrive.

### Unread Notifications

- **Bell icon** in navbar shows total unread count across all channels
- **Channel badges** display unread count per channel (e.g., "Malopolska (3)")
- Messages are automatically marked as read when you view them
- Read status persists across browser sessions and syncs across devices

By default, the live view shows messages from the last 7 days. Older messages are automatically archived and can be accessed via the date selector.

---

## Managing Channels

Access channel management:
1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Select "Manage Channels" from the slide-out menu

### Creating a New Channel

1. Click "Add New Channel"
2. Enter a channel name (letters, numbers, _ and - only)
3. Click "Create & Auto-generate Key"
4. The channel is created with a secure encryption key

### Sharing a Channel

1. In the Channels modal, click the share icon next to any channel
2. Share the QR code (scan with another device) or copy the encryption key
3. Others can join using the "Join Existing" option

### Joining a Channel

**For private channels:**
1. Click "Join Existing"

3. Leave the encryption key field empty (key is auto-generated based on channel name)
4. Click "Join Channel"
5. You can now chat with other users on the same public channel

### Deleting a Channel

1. In the Channels modal, click the delete icon (trash) next to any channel
2. Confirm the deletion
3. The channel configuration and **all its messages** will be permanently removed

**Note:** Deleting a channel removes all message history for that channel from your device to prevent data leakage when reusing channel slots.

### Switching Channels

Use the channel selector dropdown in the navbar to switch between channels. Your selection is remembered between sessions.

---

## Message Archives

Access historical messages using the date selector:

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Under "Message History" select a date to view archived messages for that day
3. Select "Today (Live)" to return to live view

Archives are created automatically at midnight (00:00 UTC) each day. The live view always shows the most recent messages (last 7 days by default).

---

## Sending Messages

1. Select your target channel using the channel selector
2. Type your message in the text field at the bottom
3. Press Enter or click "Send"
4. Your message will be published to the selected channel

**Message limit:** 140 bytes (LoRa limitation)

### Replying to Users

Click the reply button on any message to insert `@[UserName]` into the text field, then type your reply.

---

## Message Content Features

The application automatically enhances message content with interactive elements:

### Mention Badges

User mentions in the format `@[Username]` are displayed as styled blue badges (similar to the Android Meshcore app), making it easier to identify who is being addressed in a conversation.

**Example:** `@[MarWoj] test message` displays with "MarWoj" as a blue badge.

### Clickable URLs

URLs starting with `http://` or `https://` are automatically converted to clickable links that open in a new browser tab.

### Image Previews

URLs ending in `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, or `.webp` are displayed as:
- **Inline thumbnails** (max 300x200px on desktop, 200x150px on mobile)
- **Click-to-expand** - Click any thumbnail to view the full-size image in a modal preview
- **Lazy loading** - Images load only when needed for better performance
- **Error handling** - Broken images show a placeholder

**Example:** Sending `https://example.com/photo.jpg` shows a thumbnail of the image that can be clicked to view full-size.

**Note:** All content enhancements work in both channel messages and Direct Messages (DM).

---

## Direct Messages (DM)

Access the Direct Messages feature:

### From the Menu

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Select "Direct Messages" from the menu
3. Opens a dedicated full-page DM view

### Using the DM Page

1. **Select a recipient** from the dropdown at the top:
   - **Existing conversations** are shown first (with message history)
   - Separator: "--- Available contacts ---"
   - **All client contacts** from your device (only CLI type, no repeaters/rooms)
   - You can start a new conversation with anyone in your contacts list
2. Type your message in the input field (max 140 bytes, same as channels)
3. Use the emoji picker button to insert emojis
4. Press Enter or click Send
5. Click "Back" button to return to the main chat view

### Persistence

- The app remembers your last selected conversation
- When you return to the DM page, it automatically opens the last conversation you were viewing
- This works similarly to how the main page remembers your selected channel

**Note:** Only client contacts (CLI) are shown in the dropdown. Repeaters (REP), rooms (ROOM), and sensors (SENS) are automatically filtered out.

### Message Status Indicators

- ⏳ **Pending** (clock icon, yellow) - Message sent, awaiting delivery confirmation
- Note: Due to meshcore-cli limitations, we cannot track actual delivery status

### DM Notifications

- The bell icon shows a secondary green badge for unread DMs
- Each conversation shows unread indicator (*) in the dropdown
- DM badge in the menu shows total unread DM count

---

## Contact Management

Access the Contact Management feature to control who can connect to your node:

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Select "Contact Management" from the menu
3. Opens the contact management page

### Manual Contact Approval

By default, new contacts attempting to connect are automatically added to your contacts list. You can enable manual approval to control who can communicate with your node.

**Enable manual approval:**
1. On the Contact Management page, toggle the "Manual Contact Approval" switch
2. When enabled, new contact requests will appear in the Pending Contacts list
3. This setting persists across container restarts

**Security benefits:**
- **Control over network access** - Only approved contacts can communicate with your node
- **Prevention of spam/unwanted contacts** - Filter out random nodes attempting connection
- **Explicit trust model** - You decide who to trust on the mesh network

### Pending Contacts

When manual approval is enabled, new contacts appear in the Pending Contacts list for review with enriched contact information:

**View contact details:**
- Contact name with emoji (if present)
- Type badge (CLI, REP, ROOM, SENS) with color coding:
  - CLI (blue): Regular clients
  - REP (green): Repeaters
  - ROOM (cyan): Room servers
  - SENS (yellow): Sensors
- Public key prefix (first 12 characters)
- Last seen timestamp (when available)
- Map button (when GPS coordinates are available)

**Filter contacts:**
- By type: Use checkboxes to show only specific contact types (default: CLI only)
- By name or key: Search by partial contact name or public key prefix

**Approve contacts:**
- **Single approval:** Click "Approve" on individual contacts
- **Batch approval:** Click "Add Filtered" to approve all filtered contacts at once
  - Confirmation modal shows list of contacts to be approved
  - Progress indicator during batch approval

**Other actions:**
- Click "Map" button to view contact location on Google Maps (when GPS data available)
- Click "Copy Key" to copy full public key to clipboard
- Click "Refresh" to reload pending contacts list

**Note:** Always use the full public key for approval (not name or prefix). This ensures compatibility with all contact types.

### Existing Contacts

The Existing Contacts section displays all contacts currently stored on your device (CLI, REP, ROOM, SENS types).

**Features:**
- **Counter badge** - Shows current contact count vs. 350 limit (MeshCore device max)
  - Green: Normal (< 300 contacts)
  - Yellow: Warning (300-339 contacts)
  - Red (pulsing): Alarm (≥ 340 contacts)
- **Search** - Filter contacts by name or public key prefix
- **Type filter** - Show only specific contact types (All / CLI / REP / ROOM / SENS)
- **Contact cards** - Display name, type badge, public key prefix, path info, and last seen timestamp
- **Last Seen** - Shows when each contact was last active with activity indicators:
  - 🟢 **Active** (seen < 5 minutes ago)
  - 🟡 **Recent** (seen < 1 hour ago)
  - 🔴 **Inactive** (seen > 1 hour ago)
  - ⚫ **Unknown** (no timestamp available)
  - Relative time format: "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago", "3 days ago", etc.

**Managing contacts:**
1. **Search contacts:** Type in the search box to filter by name or public key prefix
2. **Filter by type:** Use the type dropdown to show only CLI, REP, ROOM, or SENS
3. **Copy public key:** Click "Copy Key" button to copy the public key prefix to clipboard
4. **Delete a contact:** Click the "Delete" button (red trash icon) and confirm

**Contact capacity monitoring:**
- MeshCore devices have a limit of 350 contacts
- The counter badge changes color as you approach the limit:
  - **0-299**: Green (plenty of space)
  - **300-339**: Yellow warning (nearing limit)
  - **340-350**: Red alarm (critical - delete some contacts soon)

### Contact Cleanup Tool

The advanced cleanup tool allows you to filter and remove contacts based on multiple criteria:

1. Navigate to **Contact Management** page (from slide-out menu)
2. Scroll to **Cleanup Contacts** section
3. Configure filters:
   - **Name Filter:** Enter partial contact name to search (optional)
   - **Advanced Filters** (collapsible):
     - **Contact Types:** Select which types to include (CLI, REP, ROOM, SENS)
     - **Date Field:** Choose between "Last Advert" (recommended) or "Last Modified"
     - **Days of Inactivity:** Contacts inactive for more than X days (0 = ignore)
4. Click **Preview Cleanup** to see matching contacts
5. Review the list and confirm deletion

**Example use cases:**
- Remove all REP contacts inactive for 30+ days: Select REP, set days to 30
- Clean specific contact names: Enter partial name (e.g., "test")

---

## Network Commands

Access network commands from the slide-out menu under "Network Commands" section:

### Send Advert (Recommended)

Sends a single advertisement frame to announce your node's presence in the mesh network. This is the normal, energy-efficient way to advertise.

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Click "Send Advert" under Network Commands
3. Wait for confirmation toast

### Flood Advert (Use Sparingly!)

Sends advertisement in flooding mode, forcing all nodes to retransmit. **Use only when:**
- Starting a completely new network
- After device reset or firmware change
- When routing is broken and node is not visible
- For debugging/testing purposes

**Warning:** Flood advertisement causes high airtime usage and can destabilize larger LoRa networks. A confirmation dialog will appear before execution.

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Click "Flood Advert" (highlighted in warning color)
3. Confirm you want to proceed
4. Wait for confirmation toast

---

## PWA Notifications

The application supports Progressive Web App (PWA) notifications to alert you of new messages when the app is hidden in the background.

### Enabling Notifications

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Click "Notifications" in the menu
3. Browser will request permission - click "Allow"
4. Status badge will change from "Disabled" to "Enabled" (green)

### How It Works

**When you'll receive notifications:**
- App must be running in the background (minimized, not closed)
- New messages arrive in channels, Direct Messages, or pending contacts
- Notification shows aggregated count: "New: 2 channels, 1 private message"

**What notifications include:**
- Total count of new messages across all categories
- Click notification to bring app back to focus
- App badge counter on home screen icon (if PWA installed)

**Disabling notifications:**
- Click "Notifications" button again to toggle off
- Status badge will change to "Disabled" (gray)

### Platform Support

**Desktop (Tested):**
- Windows - Firefox (working correctly)
- Chrome/Edge - Should work (not extensively tested)

**Mobile (Experimental):**
- **Android** - Requires further testing when installed as PWA via Chrome
  - Install: Chrome menu → "Add to Home Screen"
  - Known limitation: Android may freeze background JavaScript after 5-10 minutes for battery saving
  - Notifications will stop working after app is frozen by the OS

**Browser Requirements:**
- Chrome/Edge 81+ (desktop), 84+ (Android)
- Firefox 22+
- Safari 16.4+ (limited support)

### Installing as PWA

To get the full PWA experience with app badge counters:

**Android:**
1. Open the app in Chrome
2. Menu (⋮) → "Add to Home Screen"
3. Confirm installation
4. App icon will appear on home screen with badge counter support

**Desktop:**
1. Open the app in Chrome/Edge
2. Look for install prompt in address bar (+ icon)
3. Click "Install"
4. App opens in standalone window

### Troubleshooting Notifications

**Notifications not appearing:**
- Verify browser permission granted: Settings → Site Settings → Notifications
- Ensure app is running in background (not closed)
- Check that toggle shows "Enabled" (green badge)
- Try refreshing the page

**Badge counter not showing:**
- Badge API requires PWA to be installed (not just bookmarked)
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Edge recommended)

**Android-specific issues:**
- After 5-10 minutes in background, Android may freeze the app
- This is normal OS behavior for battery saving
- Reopen app to resume notifications
- Full "wake device" support would require Web Push API (not implemented)
