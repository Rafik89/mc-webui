# mc-webui

A lightweight web interface for meshcore-cli, providing browser-based access to MeshCore mesh network.

## Overview

**mc-webui** is a Flask-based web application that wraps `meshcore-cli`, eliminating the need for SSH/terminal access when using MeshCore chat on a LoRa device connected to a Debian VM via BLE or USB. Tested on Heltec V4.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.11+, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML5, Bootstrap 5, vanilla JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Docker / Docker Compose (2-container architecture)
- **Communication:** HTTP bridge to meshcore-cli (USB isolation for stability)
- **Data source:** `~/.config/meshcore/<device_name>.msgs` (JSON Lines)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Heltec V4 device connected via USB

**Note:** meshcore-cli is automatically installed inside the Docker container - no host installation required!

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mc-webui
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Find your serial device**
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
   ```
   Update `MC_SERIAL_PORT` in `.env` with your device path.

4. **Build and run**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
   Or from another device on your network:
   ```
   http://<server-ip>:5000
   ```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MC_SERIAL_PORT` | Path to serial device | `/dev/ttyUSB0` |
| `MC_DEVICE_NAME` | Device name (for .msgs file) | `MeshCore` |
| `MC_CONFIG_DIR` | meshcore configuration directory | `/root/.config/meshcore` |
| `MC_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | Auto-refresh interval (seconds) | `60` |
| `MC_INACTIVE_HOURS` | Inactivity threshold for cleanup | `48` |
| `MC_ARCHIVE_DIR` | Archive directory path | `/mnt/archive/meshcore` |
| `MC_ARCHIVE_ENABLED` | Enable automatic archiving | `true` |
| `MC_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_DAYS` | Days to show in live view | `7` |
| `FLASK_HOST` | Listen address | `0.0.0.0` |
| `FLASK_PORT` | Application port | `5000` |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | Debug mode | `false` |

See [.env.example](.env.example) for a complete example.

## Architecture

mc-webui uses a **2-container architecture** for improved USB stability:

1. **meshcore-bridge** - Lightweight service with exclusive USB device access
   - Runs meshcore-cli subprocess calls
   - Exposes HTTP API on port 5001 (internal only)
   - Automatically restarts on USB communication issues

2. **mc-webui** - Main web application
   - Flask-based web interface
   - Communicates with bridge via HTTP
   - No direct USB access (prevents device locking)

This separation solves USB timeout/deadlock issues common in Docker + VM environments.

## Usage

### Viewing Messages

The main page displays chat history from the currently selected channel. The app uses an intelligent refresh system that checks for new messages every 10 seconds and updates the UI only when new messages actually arrive.

**Unread notifications:**
- **Bell icon** in navbar shows total unread count across all channels
- **Channel badges** display unread count per channel (e.g., "Malopolska (3)")
- Messages are automatically marked as read when you view them
- Read status persists across browser sessions

By default, the live view shows messages from the last 7 days. Older messages are automatically archived and can be accessed via the date selector.

### Managing Channels

Access channel management:
1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Select "Manage Channels" from the slide-out menu

#### Creating a New Channel
1. Click "Add New Channel"
2. Enter a channel name (letters, numbers, _ and - only)
3. Click "Create & Auto-generate Key"
4. The channel is created with a secure encryption key

#### Sharing a Channel
1. In the Channels modal, click the share icon next to any channel
2. Share the QR code (scan with another device) or copy the encryption key
3. Others can join using the "Join Existing" option

#### Joining a Channel

**For private channels:**
1. Click "Join Existing"
2. Enter the channel name and encryption key (received from channel creator)
3. Click "Join Channel"
4. The channel will be added to your available channels

**For public channels (starting with #):**
1. Click "Join Existing"
2. Enter the channel name (e.g., `#test`, `#krakow`)
3. Leave the encryption key field empty (key is auto-generated based on channel name)
4. Click "Join Channel"
5. You can now chat with other users on the same public channel

#### Deleting a Channel
1. In the Channels modal, click the delete icon (trash) next to any channel
2. Confirm the deletion
3. The channel configuration and **all its messages** will be permanently removed

**Note:** Deleting a channel removes all message history for that channel from your device to prevent data leakage when reusing channel slots.

#### Switching Channels
Use the channel selector dropdown in the navbar to switch between channels. Your selection is remembered between sessions.

### Viewing Message Archives

Access historical messages using the date selector:

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Under "Message History" select a date to view archived messages for that day
3. Select "Today (Live)" to return to live view

Archives are created automatically at midnight (00:00 UTC) each day. The live view always shows the most recent messages (last 7 days by default).

### Sending Messages

1. Select your target channel using the channel selector
2. Type your message in the text field at the bottom
3. Press Enter or click "Send"
4. Your message will be published to the selected channel

### Replying to Users

Click the reply button on any message to insert `@[UserName]` into the text field, then type your reply.

### Direct Messages (DM)

Access the Direct Messages feature:

**From the menu:**
1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Select "Direct Messages" from the menu
3. Opens a dedicated full-page DM view

**From channel messages:**
- Click the "DM" button next to any message to start a private chat with that user
- You'll be redirected to the DM page with that conversation selected

**Using the DM page:**
1. Select a conversation from the dropdown at the top (or one opens automatically if started from a message)
2. Type your message in the input field (max 200 bytes)
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. Click "Back" button to return to the main chat view

**Message status indicators:**
- ⏳ **Pending** (yellow) - Message sent, waiting for delivery confirmation
- ⏱️ **Timeout** (red) - Delivery confirmation not received within expected time

**Notifications:**
- The bell icon shows a secondary green badge for unread DMs
- Each conversation shows unread indicator (*) in the dropdown
- DM badge in the menu shows total unread DM count

### Managing Contacts

Access the settings panel to clean up inactive contacts:
1. Click the settings icon
2. Adjust the inactivity threshold (default: 48 hours)
3. Click "Clean Inactive Contacts"
4. Confirm the action

### Network Commands

Access network commands from the slide-out menu under "Network Commands" section:

#### Send Advert (Recommended)
Sends a single advertisement frame to announce your node's presence in the mesh network. This is the normal, energy-efficient way to advertise.

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Click "Send Advert" under Network Commands
3. Wait for confirmation toast

#### Flood Advert (Use Sparingly!)
Sends advertisement in flooding mode, forcing all nodes to retransmit. **Use only when:**
- Starting a completely new network
- After device reset or firmware change
- When routing is broken and node is not visible
- For debugging/testing purposes

⚠️ **Warning:** Flood advertisement causes high airtime usage and can destabilize larger LoRa networks. A confirmation dialog will appear before execution.

1. Click the menu icon (☰) in the navbar
2. Click "Flood Advert" (highlighted in warning color)
3. Confirm you want to proceed
4. Wait for confirmation toast

## Docker Commands

```bash
# Start the application
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up -d --build

# Check container status
docker compose ps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Device not found
```bash
# Check if device is connected
ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/

# Verify device permissions
sudo chmod 666 /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Espressif*
```

### Container won't start
```bash
# Check logs for both services
docker compose logs meshcore-bridge
docker compose logs mc-webui

# Verify .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Check if ports are available
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep -E '5000|5001'
```

### USB Communication Issues
The 2-container architecture resolves common USB timeout/deadlock problems:
- **meshcore-bridge** has exclusive USB access
- **mc-webui** uses HTTP (no direct device access)
- Restarting `mc-webui` **does not** affect USB connection
- If bridge has USB issues, restart only that service:
  ```bash
  docker compose restart meshcore-bridge
  ```

### Bridge connection errors
```bash
# Check bridge health
docker compose exec mc-webui curl http://meshcore-bridge:5001/health

# Bridge logs
docker compose logs -f meshcore-bridge

# Test meshcli directly in bridge container
docker compose exec meshcore-bridge meshcli -s /dev/ttyUSB0 infos
```

### Messages not updating
- Check that `.msgs` file exists in `MC_CONFIG_DIR`
- Verify bridge service is healthy: `docker compose ps`
- Check bridge logs for command errors
